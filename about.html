      <h2>Our Mission</h2>

      <h2>Technology</h2>
      <p>This site is built entirely on open‑source tools.  We use <strong>Three.js</strong> (via Globe.gl) to power the 3‑D globe, <strong>Video.js</strong> for reliable playback of many streaming formats, and <strong>Luxon</strong> for accurate local time display.  All data comes from the community‑maintained <a href="https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IPTV‑org</a> project, which collects publicly available IPTV links from around the world.</p>

      <h2>Content Sources</h2>
      <p>Our channel listings are based on the <a href="https://iptv-org.github.io/api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IPTV‑org API</a>.  This ever‑growing directory supplies the stream URLs, channel metadata, categories and regional mapping used throughout Riggs TV.</p>
