About Riggs TV

Our Mission

Riggs TV connects viewers with free, publicly available live streams from across North and South America. Our goal is to make discovering regional television and radio channels easy and enjoyable. There’s no account required and no hidden steps—simply click and watch.

Technology

This site is built entirely on open‑source tools. We use Three.js via the Globe.gl library to render a realistic 3‑D globe. Video playback is powered by Video.js, which supports a wide range of streaming formats, including HLS. Local time information is provided using Luxon, ensuring that each channel’s primary time zone is displayed accurately. All data comes from the community‑maintained IPTV‑org project, which collects publicly available IPTV links from around the world.

Content Sources

Our channel listings are based on the IPTV‑org API . This ever‑growing directory supplies the stream URLs, channel metadata, categories and regional mapping used throughout Riggs TV. Only North and South American countries are included on this site.

Legal Disclaimer

Riggs TV does not host, own or control any video content. We provide links to streams that are publicly available on the Internet and that we believe have been authorised for distribution by their copyright holders. If you are a rights holder and believe a stream should not be listed here, please contact the IPTV‑org maintainers to have the source link removed. Removing a link from this site does not remove it from the web.
